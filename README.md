Calculates 103 firm characteristics from CRSP + Compustat directly in Python â€“ no WRDS SAS cloud


## Requirements ## 
For this code to work, there you must fulfill three key requirements:
1. You must have a valid WRDS account and have completed the pgpass file setup (see https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/programming-wrds/programming-python/python-from-your-computer/)
2. You must have a valid BLS account with access key (see https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/)  
3. You must have a valid FRED account with access key (see https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)


## Disclaimer ##
Even though this code achieves a very high correlation with Jermiah Green's SAS code, I do not claim that my code is free of errors. Therefore, I am grateful for any feedback or constructive suggestion for improvement.
